# Google Meet Headshot Photography

A Bot that captures when new people come in Google Meet room, take their photo, say bye, and wait for the next customer.

Random 2-hour coding, wanted to see how well this can work.
Not that good due to Google-Meet client having chaotic user-video display layout, hard to focus on a set boundary to capture single user's face.

## Usage:
```
  pip3 install -r requirement.txt
  mkdir photos/

  # Have google-meet opened in another screen, please have right-side menu open too.
  python3 index.py

  # Follow instruction of the terminal output
```
